# Open-Connect-Kenya
Open contributors and users, welcome to the chatroom! We are here to make Open a default one open enthusiast at a time by sharing, learning and taking action in our communities

I am working towards launching a platform that will help reduce the disconnect between the practice and the use of open in Kenya. This project will also include mentorship program and open resources components to it. Open resources will be specific to Kenya's context. Thus, the contributors and users will be able to learn from each other as they share and use open resources. As a result, shaping policy within open landscape in the future. 

Why this project? 
Just as any other social movement in the past, Socioeconomic divides and disconnect between advocates and scienntists have negatively influenced and continue influencing their progress. We don't want the same with Open movement in Kenya. As a result, while sharing with OLS 2020 mentees, we will create a platform enabling open science and policy advocates as well as open practitioners work as a team while supported through mentorship and availability of Open resources. We are here to ensure Open enthusiasts whether newbie or veteran can be able to identify myths and facts in order to bridge disconnect within open movement in Kenya.
