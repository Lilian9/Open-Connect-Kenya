# Open-Connect-Kenya
Open contributors and users, welcome to the chatroom! We are here to make Open a default one open enthusiast at a time by sharing, learning and taking action in our communities

As an Open Life Science project lead, Iâ€™m working with Dr Caleb Kibet (OLS mentor) in establishing a platform that will connect open contributors and users, initiate mentorship program between them and develop country- specific Open resources in Kenya so that they can upload, recreate and download tools and resources on open access, open data, open education and open science materials freely while shaping open policy in the future.
