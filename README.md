**Why this project?**

**The Problem**
* Over the years, socioeconomic and political divides in the society has created gap within social movements all over the world. Kenya is not an exception
* Open enthusiasts in Kenya, Africa are working in isolation meaning the disconnect between open contributors and users is inevitable in the future.

So, we are doing this to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself with the open movement in Kenya. Not having one strong voice whether we like it or not will negatively influence or continue influencing their progress. 

**The Solution**

The Open Connect- Kenya will:
* Create a website chat room
* Add country-specific open resources links to the chat room
* Initiate mentorship program among open contributors and users who have joined the chat room

By launching this platform everyone will be able to interact with each other directly while exploring and contributing to Kenya- specific Open resources added to it. Furthermore, development within *Open* landscape will be changing as years progresses. Therefore, having mentorship program is a way of building the capacity of the contributors and users in shaping policies within *Open* landscape due to the ever changing concepts.

**What we Need to Make it Work!**

Anyone willing to help in any way.

We are looking for people who are knowledgable or with expertise in website chat room, adding chat room to a website, documentation, open science research, grant proposal writing and project management.

We'd love the feedback of *Open Contributors* and *Open Users* as we continue working on this platform. Encouraging you as well to join the platform once developed.

The purpose of this platform is to reduce the disconnect between people practicing and using *Open* in Kenya. This project will also include mentorship program and open resources components to it. Open resources will be specific to Kenya's context. Thus, the contributors and users will be able to learn from each other as they share and use **Open resources**. As a result, shaping policy within *Open landscape* in the future.
