**Why this project?**

**The Problem**
* Over the years socioeconomic divides in the society has created gap within social movements all over the world. Kenya is not an exception
* Open enthusiasts in Kenya, Africa are working in isolation meaning the disconnect between open contributors and users is inevitable in the future.

So, we are doing this to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself with the open movement in Kenya. Not having one strong voice whether we like it or not will negatively influence or continue influencing their progress. 

**The Solution**
The Open Connect- Kenya will:
* Create a website chat room
* Add country-specific open resources links to the chat room
* Initiate mentorship program among open contributors and users who have joined the chat room

By launching this platform everyone will be able to interact with each other directly while exploring and contributing to the Open resources which Kenya- specofoc content added to it. Furthermore, development within *Open* landscape will be changing as years progresses therefore, having mentorship program is a way of building the capacity of the contributors and users in shaping policies within *Open* landscape.
