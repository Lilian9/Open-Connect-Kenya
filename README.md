***A platform that will ensure no open contributor and user is left behind when shaping Open landscape in Kenya***

**Hello there!** 
**Welcome!**

## **Why this project?**

### **The Problem**
* Over the years, socioeconomic and political divides in the society has created gap within social movements all over the world. Kenya is not an exception
* Open enthusiasts in Kenya, Africa are working in isolation meaning the disconnect between open contributors and users is inevitable in the future.

So, we are doing this to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself with the open movement in Kenya. Not having one strong voice whether we like it or not will negatively influence or continue influencing the progress of everyone within **_Open_** landscape. 

### **The Solution**

The Open Connect- Kenya will:
* Create a webpage with **Open Resources** with a link to a chat room  
* Launch **Gitter** chat room where **Open Contributors and Users** will be sharing with each other
* Initiate mentorship program among open contributors and users who have joined the chat room

By launching these platforms, everyone will be able to interact with each other and the Open resources. Furthermore, development within **_Open_** landscape will be changing as years progresses. Therefore, having mentorship program is a way of building the capacity of the contributors and users in shaping policies within it due to the ever changing concepts.

## **About Us**

Lilian Juma is the founder of **Open Connect- Kenya Platform** as [Open Life Sciences](https://openlifesci.org/) 2020 project lead. Development of this platform is made possible due to mentorship provided for by OLS mentor, **Caleb Kibet**. 

Caleb is a 2019/2020 Mozilla Fellow and a Bioinformatician, interested in teaching, open science, reproducibility, machine learning, FAIR Genomics, and community building. 

Lilian is an [OpenCon](https://www.opencon2018.org/) alumni who has hosted three [OpenCon](https://www.opencon2018.org/) satellite conferences in Kenya and Algeria reaching more than 300 ECRs, students and policy makers. In 2017, she was awarded [Right to Research Coalition Next Generation Leadership Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H79sVT1bEb8&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR21OnV8SOsNEUdQ_7iN9EigSAblNZ_jhB_HOkg29n3lF5_rWpU4OMFGdQ0) for championing for Open Access as well as initiating Train the Trainers project in Kenya's universities.

## **What we Need to Make this Possible!**

Anyone willing to help in any way.

We are looking for people who are knowledgable or with expertise in GitHub, adding chat room to a website, documentation, open science research, grant proposal writing and project management.

We'd love the feedback of **Open Contributors and Open Users** as we continue working on this platform. Encouraging you as well to join the platform once developed.

The purpose of this platform is to reduce the disconnect between people practicing and using *Open* in Kenya. This project will also include mentorship program and open resources components to it. Open resources will be specific to Kenya's context. Thus, the contributors and users will be able to learn from each other as they share and use **Open resources**. As a result, shaping policy within *Open landscape* in the future.
