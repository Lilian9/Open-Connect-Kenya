# Open-Connect-Kenya
Open contributors and users, welcome to the chatroom! We are here to make Open a default one open enthusiast at a time by sharing, learning and taking action in our communities

As an Open Life Science project lead, Iâ€™m working with Dr Caleb Kibet (OLS mentor) in establishing a platform that will connect open contributors and users, initiate mentorship program between them and develop country- specific Open resources in Kenya so that they can upload, recreate and download tools and resources on open access, open data, open education and open science materials freely while shaping open policy in the future. 

Why this project? 
Just as any other social movement in the past, Socioeconomic divides and disconnect between advocates and scienntists have negatively influenced and continue influencing their progress. We don't want the same with Open movement in Kenya. As a result, while sharing with OLS 2020 mentees, we will create a platform enabling open science and policy advocates as well as open practitioners work as a team while supported through mentorship and availability of Open resources. We are here to ensure Open enthusiasts whether newbie or veteran can be able to identify myths and facts in order to bridge disconnect within open movement in Kenya.
